# 6018FinalProj
This repo is for the final project in CS 6018. This contains a UI only demo of a 'Captain's Log' Android app. 

# Project Spec:

Final Assignment

Read through the "pitch" below which might have come from a student in the business school.

This is a partner project, so you'll work with a classmate and submit the plan + prototype + video together. The plan should primarily be developed TOGETHER, like, while talking either in person or over Zoom. It's important to me that you be discussing your outline of the implementation with your partner. If you want to divide and conquer on the implementation and/or video, go for it.

Your job is to develop

A detailed plan of all components of the system (a PDF)
For the Android app, this will consist of proposed signatures for the relevant Activity, Composables, ViewModels, Repositories, and other classes you think you'll need to implement
For backend systems, API routes that will be exposed to clients, description/API of services, description of what containers will be running and how they will communicate with each other
For any AI models that are being, propose a pre-trained model that can be used, and describe any fine tuning that might need to be performed to adapt it. Be specific about what data you think would be required to perform any necessary fine tuning
Any risks in terms of tehnologies you'll need to use that you're unfamiliar with
A Prototype of the frontend system (in a git repo)
This can rely on hardcoded data, and can use some placeholder elements
It should be enough that you can "demo" the app and explain what it does and what it "would do"
As an example, you can replace an API call with {delay(500); use(hardcodedValue)}
An 8-10 minute video presentation that you might show to the client who asked you for a bid on this project. It should describe the proposed app organization and components, and show the functional features of your demo to explain how the app "would work"
Due Dates:

Team formation: tell me by Monday, Oct 27 who you're working with, ideally tell me today!
The detailed plan is due by Thursday, Oct 30
The demo + video are due by Thursday, Nov 6 (you can update the plan if you'd like as you learn stuff building the prototype)
You'll be assigned classmate plans to review on Oct 31, and your reviews will also be due Nov 6
The Pitch

Hey, I just need a coder to build this super cool idea. I tried to vibe code it but that didn't work because I guess my prompt wasn't good enough. Oh, I can't pay you for the work, but the experience and exposure will be invaluable!

I want you to build a "captain's log" app like Star Trek (basically a voice recorder).

Users should be able to record captains log notes. They need to be able to play back the audio, but I also want them to be able to read transcriptions too. I want this to be a social app, so users should be able to have "friends" in the app and be able to share log notes with them, too. Oh, and I want a search feature that lets users find log entries, like, "what did I think about the gamma quadrant?" or "what were Spock and Bones arguing about?"

Before I agree to choose you for this unpaid project, I need you to give me a detailed design that I'll run by my cousin who's a software engineer, but also I want a video and prorotype app. Thanks! Oh yeah, huh, yeah, copyright, let's not worry about that. CBS doesn't seem litigous
